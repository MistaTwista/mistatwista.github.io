## Think about the result
It's really so much distractions around us so we need a place with guide for our work, so write down and put it near you.

### Understand the situation
Ask yourself:

1. What do I do?
2. Why do I do it? Why do I need to do it?
3. Is there any better way?

### Check your understandings
Do I understand it right? This question can help you and your colleagues to understand each other.

### Write everything
Write down everything you know about the problem. You can check it later and get to work faster.

## Plan it
Remove all unnecessary points and think about time for remaining tasks.

### Make the list for all tasks

- Decompose you monster to little parts and it will never scare you.
- Can you remove something?
- Can you delegate something?
- You need to do the work, you can refactor it later.

### Estimate how long it will take for each of the task
You can understand when will you finish it.

### Place the job in the right order

- Try to place complex cognitive tasks at the top of the list.
- Don't forget about dependencies!
- Do you need someone else? Take buffer for their work.

### Make the task schedule
Put the tasks in you calendar

**Planning without action is just a plan.**

## Pomodoro cycle
Divide you work into 25 min segments.

- 25 work
- 5 break
- After four cycles take 15-30 min break

### Little tricks

1. Use looped slightly rhythmic ambient music that create your flow.
2. Do real break during short breaks (go to the toilet, wash face, drink water, stretch, meditate, etc.). Do not open social networks or email!
3. Do exercises during long breaks (push ups, squats, jumps). You can go up and down the stairs.
